Recently, I applied for a role at Audible. The process was quite streamlined, and I wanted to share my experience for anyone who might be going through something similar.

## Application Process

June 24

I came across the role [Software Development Engineer, Data Platforms](https://www.audiblecareers.com/job/newark/software-development-engineer-data-platforms/27552/66615918064) at Audible and decided to apply through a referral from a friend who works there. The very next day, a recruiter reached out to me and sent me an online assessment to complete.

## Online Assessment

June 26

The online assessment was hosted on HackerRank and consisted of two coding questions followed by three work simulations and workstyle surveys.

### Coding Questions

The first question was of medium difficulty, while the second was quite challenging. I had 90 minutes to complete both questions. The first question was similar to a LC medium problem which required some logical thinking and problem-solving skills. The second question was a hard problem that was related to deques. I managed to solve both questions, which I felt pretty good about.

### Work Simulations and Workstyle Surveys

The work simulations and workstyle surveys were designed to evaluate how well I would fit into the company's culture and how I handle typical work scenarios. These were straightforward and didn't take too much time.

## Phone Screen Interview

July 01

After passing the online assessment, I was scheduled for a phone screen interview. It was mostly focused on data structures and algorithms, with a few questions about my previous work experience including audible's people principles.

July 03

This round consisted of two parts:

1. **Discussion on Previous Work Experience and People Principles** (30 minutes):

   - This part focused on my past work experience and how I align with Audible's People Principles. It was more of a conversational round and allowed me to talk about my background and values.

2. **Coding Questions** (30 minutes):
   - The first question was very similar to [this problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists). I was able to solve it fairly quickly.
   - The second question was a follow-up to the first. I also managed to answer this one within the time limit.
   - With about 10 minutes remaining, the interviewer asked a more complex follow-up question related to "n houses." Unfortunately, I couldn't complete this part within the time frame.

## Outcome

July 10

I felt the interview went well overall and was optimistic about moving to the next round. However, a few days later, I received a rejection email without any feedback.

## Reflections

Although I was disappointed with the outcome, I found the entire process to be a valuable learning experience.

For anyone preparing for an interview at Audible, I recommend brushing up on data structures and algorithms, and being ready to discuss your previous work experiences in detail with audible's people principles in mind.

Good luck!
