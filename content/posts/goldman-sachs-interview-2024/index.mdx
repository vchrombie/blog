I recently had the opportunity to interview with Goldman Sachs for the [Global Markets, Software Engineer, Securities Settlements, New York](https://higher.gs.com/roles/131593) position, and I'd like to share my experience.

June 27

My friend referred me for the position, and I received an invitation from HR to apply. The first step was to schedule a CoderPad interview.

## CoderPad Interview

July 02

The CoderPad interview included three questions:

1. **Find a Cycle in an Array**
   - I had seen this question before, so the interviewer decided to skip it.
2. **Shortest Distance Between Two Midpoints in Number of Characters**
   - You can find a similar question [here](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/4642672/Goldman-Sachs-Coderpad-Round).
3. **Pascal's Triangle Function**
   - I was able to solve this one using recursion.

With two out of three questions successfully solved, I was invited to a virtual onsite interview that consisted of four rounds.

## Virtual Onsite Interview

July 12

### Round 1: Data Structures

The first round focused on data structures such as stacks, queues, and sorting algorithms, including their time complexities. I was also given a problem to find the root of the largest tree in a forest of one or more disconnected trees. You can see a similar problem [here](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1204670/amazon-interview-question-root-of-largest-tree-in-a-forest). I answered all the questions but used tree algorithms like DFS, which wasnâ€™t the optimal approach.

### Round 2: Software Engineering Practices

The second round involved a real-time problem related to securities transactions. This round tested my practical knowledge and understanding of software engineering principles in a real-world scenario.

### Round 3: Software Design and Architecture

In this round, I faced questions on SQL queries, filtering, and database indexing. The interviewer discussed about cache hydration, and asked what is the optimal policy to hydrate the data into cache.

### Round 4: Hiring Manager Round

Unfortunately, the fourth round was cancelled because the hiring manager was on sick leave. I was informed that this round would be rescheduled.

## Follow-Up

July 17

After waiting for a few days, I followed up with HR regarding the rescheduled round. However, HR replied that they had decided to move forward with another applicant and would not be conducting the fourth round.

## Conclusion

Though I didn't get the job, the interview process at Goldman Sachs was a valuable learning experience. If you're preparing for an interview with Goldman Sachs for an Analyst role, make sure to brush up on data structures, algorithms, real-world problem-solving, and database management.

Good luck!
