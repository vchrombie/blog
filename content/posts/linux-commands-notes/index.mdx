Linux is a free and open source operating system based on Unix. The difference between Linux and Unix is that Unix is a proprietary operating system, while Linux is open source.

- **kernel**: the core of the operating system, manages the hardware resources of the computer

- **shell**: a command line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system (bash, zsh, ksh)

- **distribution**: a version of the Linux operating system that includes the Linux kernel and additional software

## Basics

- outputs the string that is passed to it as an argument

```console
$ echo "Hello World"
Hello World
```

- outputs the hostname of the system

```console
$ hostname
w4nd
```

- outputs the username of the current user

```console
$ whoami
p0tt3r
```

- outputs the present working directory

```console
$ pwd
/Users/p0tt3r/dev
```

- **relative path**: relative to the present working directory, start from current directory

- **absolute path**: relative to the root directory, start from root directory

- creates a new directory

```console
$ mkdir test
```

- change the current directory to test

```console
$ cd test
```

- creates a new file

```console
$ touch file.txt
```

- edit an existing file or create a new file

```console
$ nano file.txt
```

- display the contents of a file

```console
$ cat file.txt
Hi
```

- copy a file, copy contents of file.txt to file2.txt

```console
$ cp file.txt file2.txt
```

- rename a file, move the contents of file2.txt to file3.txt

```console
$ mv file2.txt file3.txt
```

- search for a string or pattern in a file

```console
$ grep pattern files

$ grep "Hi" file.txt
```

- recursively search for a string in a directory

```console
$ grep -r pattern dir

$ grep -r "Hi" test
```

- search for multiple strings in a file

```console
$ egrep "Lorem|dolor|id" file3.txt
```

- read a file without using the cat command

```console
$ less file3.txt
$ more file3.txt
```

advantage of using less or more is that it allows you to scroll through the file

- list all files in the current directory

```console
$ ls
file.txt file3.txt
```

- list all files in the current directory with permissions

```console
$ ll
$ ls -l
total 16
-rw-r--r--  1 p0tt3r  staff    3 Aug  5 14:31 file.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 p0tt3r  staff  446 Aug  5 15:08 file3.txt
```

`getfacl` command is used to get file access control lists

- displays the IP address of the system

```console
$ ip addr show
$ ifconfig
```

- displays the first 5 lines of a file and the last 5 lines of a file

```console
$ head -5 file3.txt
$ tail -5 file3.txt
```

- list all files including hidden files

```console
$ la
$ ls -a
```

- displays the history of commands that have been executed

```console
$ history
```

- root is the admin/superuser, has all the permissions

```
/root - home directory of the root user
/ - root directory
```

- **inode (index node)**: a data structure that stores information about a file or directory except its name and actual data, every file has a unique identifier number

```console
$ ls -li
total 16
115609748 -rw-r--r--  1 p0tt3r  staff    3 Aug  5 14:31 file.txt
115610387 -rw-r--r--  1 p0tt3r  staff  446 Aug  5 15:08 file3.txt
```

- find a file in the filesystem

```console
$ find dir -name file

$ find . -name file.txt
./file.txt
```

```console
$ locate file.txt
```

- count the number of words and lines in a file

```console
$ wc file3.txt
       6      69     446 file3.txt
```

- **pipe (|)**: takes the output of one command and uses it as input for another command

```console
$ ls -l | grep file3
-rw-r--r--  1 p0tt3r  staff  446 Aug  5 15:08 file3.txt
```

- check the difference between two files

```console
$ diff file.txt file3.txt
```

- remove a file

```console
$ rm file.txt
```

- remove a directory

```console
$ rmdir test
```

- permanently remove a file (unable to recover)

```console
$ shred -u file.txt
```

- check system architecture and hardware information

```console
$ lscpu
```

- combine two files

```console
$ cat file.txt file3.txt > file4.txt
```

- check the type of the file

```console
$ file file3.txt
file3.txt: ASCII text
```

- sort the contents of a file

```console
$ cat file3.txt| sort
$ sort file3.txt
```

- access linux server from another linux server: putty, ssh

- create a tar archive

```console
$ tar -cvf archive.tar file3.txt
```

- extract a tar archive

```console
$ tar -xvf archive.tar
```

- compress a file

```console
$ gzip file3.txt
```

- decompress a file

```console
$ gunzip file3.txt.gz
```

- compress a directory

```console
$ tar -zcvf archive.tar.gz test
```

- decompress a directory

```console
$ tar -zxvf archive.tar.gz
```

- system and kernel information

```console
$ uname -a
Darwin w4nd 23.5.0 Darwin Kernel Version 23.5.0: Wed May  1 20:19:05 PDT 2024; root:xnu-10063.121.3~5/RELEASE_ARM64_T8112 arm64
```

- check the system uptime

```console
$ uptime
0:54  up 2 days,  5:06, 2 users, load averages: 1.24 1.78 2.03
```

- set environment variables

```console
$ export VAR=value
```

- check the environment variables

```
$ env
$ printenv
```

- package manager: command line tool that allows you to install, update, and remove software packages (apt-get, yum, dnf)

```console
# apt-get is a package manager for debian based systems

# install and remove a package
$ apt-get install package
$ apt-get remove package

# update package list
$ apt-get update

# upgrade all packages
$ apt-get upgrade
```

## File Permissions

- different types of permissions

  - read (r) : 4
  - write (w) : 2
  - execute (x) : 1

- different types of users

  - user owner (u)
  - user group (g)
  - others (o)
  - all (a)

- check the permissions of a file

```console
$ ls -l file3.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 p0tt3r  staff  446 Aug  5 15:08 file3.txt
```

```console
$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x  2 p0tt3r  staff   64 Aug  6 00:57 dir
-rw-r--r--  1 p0tt3r  staff    0 Aug  5 17:52 file.txt

# File type: -
# Permission settings: rw-r--r--
# User owner: p0tt3r
# Group owner: staff
# File size: 0
# Last modification time: Aug 5 17:52
# Filename: file.txt
```

- when permissions and users are represented by letters, that is called symbolic mode

- when permissions and users are represented by numbers, that is called octal mode

- `rwxr--r–` is a set of three different permissions

  - `rwx`: user owner has read, write and execute permissions
  - `r--`: user group has read permissions
  - `r--`: others have read permissions

- `rwxr--r–` is represented by `744` in octal mode

  - `rwx` = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
  - `r--` = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4
  - `r--` = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4

- change the permissions of a file

```console
$ chmod 777 file3.txt

$ ls -l file3.txt
-rwxrwxrwx  1 p0tt3r  staff  446 Aug  5 15:08 file3.txt
```

- change the owner of a file

```console
$ chown user file3.txt
```

- change the group of a file

```console
$ chgrp group file3.txt
```

- create a symbolic link (`l` denotes a symbolic link)

```console
$ ln -s file3.txt file4.txt

$ ls -l
lrwxr-xr-x  1 p0tt3r  staff    9 Aug  6 01:19 file4.txt -> file3.txt
```

- **symbolic link** or symlink is a pointer to a file or directory, can be used to create shortcuts

  - A **hard link** is a direct reference to the inode of a file. Multiple hard links to a file share the same inode and, therefore, the same data. Deleting the original file does not affect the hard link.

  ```console
  $ ln file3.txt file5.txt
  ```

  - A **soft link** is a pointer to a file or directory. It is a separate file that contains a path to the original file. Deleting the original file makes the soft link invalid, resulting in a broken link.

  ```console
  $ ln -s file3.txt file6.txt
  ```

- setuid/setguid permissions are used to run a program with the permissions of the owner of the file (`s`/`S` denotes setuid/setguid)
  - setuid: set user id
  - setguid: set group id

```console
$ chmod u+s file3.txt
$ chmod g+s file3.txt
```

- sticky bit is used to restrict the deletion of a file (`t`/`T` denotes sticky bit)

```console
$ chmod +t file3.txt
```

## Redirection

- write something to a file, redirect the output of a command to a file

```console
$ echo "Hi" > file.txt
$ cat file3.txt > file4.txt
$ ls -l > files.txt
```

- append something to a file

```console
$ echo "Hello" >> file.txt
$ cat file3.txt >> file4.txt
$ ls -l >> files.txt
```

- redirect an error to a file

```console
$ cat abc
cat: abc: No such file or directory

$ cat abc 2> error.txt
```

- redirect both output and error to a file

```console
$ cat abc 2>&1 output.txt
```

## Automation

- **cronjob**: automate any task or script

- **cron**: a daemon that runs in the background and executes scheduled tasks

- **crontab**: a file that contains the cronjobs

- create a cronjob

```console
$ crontab -e
```

- check the cronjobs that are running

```console
$ crontab -l
```

- `* * * * *` represents minute (0-59) hour (0-23) day (1-31) month (1-12) day_of_week (0-6)

- run a script every minute

```console
* * * * * echo "1 minute"
```

- run a script every hour

```console
0 * * * * echo "1 hour"
```

- run a script every day

```console
0 0 * * * echo "1 day"
```

- run a script every day at 12:30

```console
30 12 * * * echo "12:30"
```

- debug a cronjob
  - check system time
  - crontab entry
  - check /var/log/messages

## Services

- **daemon**: a background process that runs continuously, eg. apache, mysql, httpd

- check the status of a service

```console
$ systemctl status sshd
```

- start/stop/restart a service

```console
$ systemctl start sshd
$ systemctl stop sshd
$ systemctl restart sshd
```

- enable/disable a service

```console
$ systemctl enable sshd
$ systemctl disable sshd
```

- `httpd` is the daemon that runs on the server which helps in establishing a connection over HTTP/HTTPS

### System Monitoring

- check free disk space

```console
$ df -ah

# -a for all filesystems, -h for human readable format
```

- check disk usage, size of the directory

```console
$ du -sh /home

# -s for summary, -h for human readable format
```

- show free memory

```console
$ free -h
```

- check CPU usage

```console
$ top
$ htop
$ btop
```

## Process

- **process**: a running instance of a program

- **PID (Process ID)**: unique identifier for each process

- check the process that is running

```console
$ ps aux

$ ps aux | grep process_name
```

- kill a process

```console
$ kill <PID>
```

| Signal  | Value | Action    | Command          |
| ------- | ----- | --------- | ---------------- |
| SIGTERM | 15    | Terminate | `kill -15 <PID>` |
| SIGKILL | 9     | Kill      | `kill -9 <PID>`  |
| SIGINT  | 2     | Interrupt | `kill -2 <PID>`  |

`SIGTERM`: signal terminate, the process can catch the signal and perform cleanup operations before terminating, gracefully kills the process, can be caught and ignored and does not kill child processes

```console
$ sleep 100 &
[1] 27093

$ kill -15 27093
[1]  + 27093 terminated  sleep 100
```

`SIGKILL`: signal kill, the process cannot catch the signal, the process is killed immediately, inevitable and kills child processes

```console
$ sleep 100 &
[1] 27038

$ kill -9 27038
[1]  + 27038 killed     sleep 100
```

`SIGINT`: signal interrupt (keyboard interrupt), the process can catch the signal and perform cleanup operations before terminating

```console
$ sleep 100 &
[1] 26982

$ kill -2 26982
[1]  + 26982 interrupt  sleep 100
```

- kill all processes that match a name

```console
$ killall process_name
```

## Networking

- check the IP address of the system

```console
$ ip addr show
$ ifconfig
```

- check if a IP/server is accessible

```console
$ ping www.google.com
PING www.google.com (142.250.72.100): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 142.250.72.100: icmp_seq=0 ttl=60 time=41.297 ms
^C
--- www.google.com ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 41.297/41.297/41.297/0.000 ms

# 0.0% packet loss means the server is accessible
```

```console
$ telnet www.google.com 80
Trying 142.250.80.4...
Connected to www.google.com.
```

- check network interfaces and IP addresses

```console
$ netstat
$ ifconfig
```

- display listening ports and the programs that are using them

```console
$ netstat -tulnp
```

- check the process that is running on a specific port

```console
$ lsof -i :port

$ netstat -tulnp | grep port
```

- configure network packet filtering rules, define the rules for incoming and outgoing packets

```console
$ iptables
```

- check the routing table

```console
$ route -n
```

- check the path that packets take to reach a destination

```console
$ tracepath www.google.com
```

- dump socket statistics

```console
$ ss -tulnp

# -t for TCP, -u for UDP, -l for listening, -n for numeric, -p for process
```

- query internet name servers interactively

```console
$ nslookup www.google.com
```

- check the DNS records of a domain (DNS lookup utility)

```console
$ dig www.google.com
```

## SSH

- **SSH (Secure Shell)**: communication protocol that provides a secure way to access a remote computer, communiucation between the host and the client is encrypted

- default port for SSH is 22

- `sshd` is the daemon that runs on the server which helps in establishing a secure connection over SSH

- connect to a remote server

```console
$ ssh user@hostname
$ ssh user@192.168.x.x
```

- connect to a remote server with a different port

```console
$ ssh -p port user@hostname
```

- copy files from local to remote server

```console
$ scp file.txt user@hostname:/path
```

- copy files from remote server to local

```console
$ scp user@hostname:/path/file.txt .
```

- generate rsa key pair

```console
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

- copy the public key to the remote server

```console
$ ssh-copy-id user@hostname
```

- ssh security can be improved by disabling root login, changing the default port, using key-based authentication, and using a firewall

## File System

- **filesystem**: a method of organizing and storing files on a computer

- **root directory**: the top-level directory in the filesystem, represented by `/`

- **home directory**: the directory where a user's files are stored, represented by `~`

- `/etc` directory contains configuration files

  - `/etc/passwd` file contains information about the users on the system
  - `/etc/shadow` file contains the encrypted passwords of the users
  - `/etc/group` file contains information about the groups on the system
  - `/etc/fsatb` file contains information about the filesystems on the system
  - `/etc/hosts` file contains information about the hostname and IP address mappings
  - `/etc/resolv.conf` file contains information about the DNS servers
  - `/etc/hostname` file contains the hostname of the system
  - `/etc/ssh` directory contains configuration files for the SSH server
  - `/etc/cron.*` directories contain cronjobs

- `/var` directory contains variable data files, such as logs, databases, and mail

  - `/var/log` directory contains system log files
  - `/var/mail` directory contains mail files

- `/tmp` directory contains temporary files

- `/dev` directory contains device files

- `/home` directory contains the home directories of the users

- `/bin` directory contains binary files and executable programs
