Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are like blueprints that you can customize to solve particular design problems in your code. In this blog post, we'll cover some of the most common design patterns in Python: Singleton, Composite, Factory, and Proxy. Let's dive into each one with simple explanations and examples.

## Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton Design Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class IPerson(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def person_type(self):
        # Interface method
        pass


class Person(IPerson):

    __instance = None

    def get_instance():
        if Person.__instance is None:
            Person("Default", 0)
        return Person.__instance

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        if Person.__instance is not None:
            raise Exception("This class is a singleton!")
        else:
            self.name = name
            self.age = age
            Person.__instance = self

    @staticmethod
    def person_type():
        print(f"Person Name: {Person.__instance.name}")
        print(f"Person Age: {Person.__instance.age}")


p1 = Person("John", 25)
print(p1)
p1.person_type()
# <__main__.Person object at 0x100eb5ca0>
# Person Name: John
# Person Age: 25

p3 = Person.get_instance()
print(p3)
p3.person_type()
# <__main__.Person object at 0x100eb5ca0>
# Person Name: John
# Person Age: 25

p2 = Person("Jack", 30)
# Exception: This class is a singleton!
```

## Composite Design Pattern

The Composite Design Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod, abstractstaticmethod


class IDepartment(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def __init__(self, employees):
        # Interface method
        pass

    @abstractstaticmethod
    def get_name():
        # Interface method
        pass


class Accounting(IDepartment):
    def __init__(self, employees):
        self.employees = employees

    def get_name(self):
        print("Accounting {}".format(self.employees))


class Development(IDepartment):
    def __init__(self, employees):
        self.employees = employees

    def get_name(self):
        print("Development {}".format(self.employees))


class ParentDepartment(IDepartment):
    def __init__(self, employees):
        self.employees = employees
        self.base_employees = employees
        self.departments = []

    def add_department(self, department):
        self.departments.append(department)
        self.employees += department.employees

    def get_name(self):
        print("Parent Department {}".format(self.base_employees))
        for department in self.departments:
            department.get_name()
        print("Total Employees {}".format(self.employees))


d1 = Accounting(200)
d2 = Development(300)
d3 = ParentDepartment(50)
d3.add_department(d1)
d3.add_department(d2)

d3.get_name()
# Parent Department 50
# Accounting 200
# Development 300
# Total Employees: 550
```

## Factory Design Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class IPerson(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def person_type(self):
        # Interface method
        pass


# p = IPerson()
# TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class IPerson 
# with abstract method person_type

class Teacher(IPerson):
    def person_type(self):
        return "Teacher"


class Student(IPerson):
    def person_type(self):
        return "Student"


t = Teacher()
print(t.person_type())  # Teacher

s = Student()
print(s.person_type())  # Student


class PersonFactory:

    @staticmethod
    def get_person(person_type):
        if person_type == "Teacher":
            return Teacher()
        if person_type == "Student":
            return Student()
        raise TypeError("Invalid person type")


person_type = input("Enter person type (Teacher/Student): ")
try:
    person = PersonFactory.get_person(person_type)
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
else:
    print(person.person_type())
```

## Proxy Design Pattern

The Proxy Design Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. The proxy object acts as an intermediary between the client and the real object, performing various tasks such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, etc.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class IPerson(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def person_type(self):
        # Interface method
        pass


class Person(IPerson):
    def person_type(self):
        return "Person"


class ProxyPerson(IPerson):
    def __init__(self):
        self.person = Person()

    def person_type(self):
        return "Proxy " + self.person.person_type()


p1 = Person()
print(p1.person_type())
# Person

p2 = ProxyPerson()
print(p2.person_type())
# Proxy Person
```

## Conclusion

These design patterns provide a solid foundation for solving common design problems. By understanding and using these patterns, you can create more flexible, reusable, and maintainable code.
