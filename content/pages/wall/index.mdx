My Name is Venu Vardhan Reddy Tekula, previously worked as a Backend Developer at [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/).

I worked as a Student Developer ([Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2020 participant) with 
[CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/), a Linux Foundation Project and Bitergia, implementing the bridge between [GrimoireLab](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab) & 
[Prosoul](https://github.com/Bitergia/prosoul) and providing a workflow to evaluate projects using the Quality Models. You can read the work final report from here, 
[reporte final](https://vchrombie.github.io/blog/gsoc-final-report/).

I completed my undergraduate studies in CSE at 
[Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/), Kollam. I am also a member of 
[amFOSS](https://amfoss.in/), the Open Source club of Amrita. I mentor students and help them to pull up their first contribution to Open Source. I can teach them the difference between Git and GitHub.

I like to travel and cook. I usually play with data, plot graphs with them and show the results to people. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Rollercoaster ride of my grades in BTech. I did well, umm, I guess. üé¢

The exponential growth of [GitLab.org](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/) projects. All thanks to the all the developers who worked really hard. But, observed one peculiar trend in the visualization. There is a steep fall in the activity trend almost every year ending, more clearly visible in the last three years.
Seems like the devs are having a good time with the family. üéÑüéÖüéÅ
