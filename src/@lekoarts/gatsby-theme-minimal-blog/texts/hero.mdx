I'm Venu, a software engineer.

> Actively looking for Summer/Fall 2024 internships or full-time opportunities!

I graduated (MS CS, 2024) from [Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). I completed my undergraduate (BTech CSE, 2020) from [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri](https://www.amrita.edu/campus/amritapuri/)

I previously worked as Software Engineer (mostly Backend and DevOps) at [FloodNet NYC](https://www.floodnet.nyc/) project (collaboration with [NYU CUSP](https://cusp.nyu.edu/)), [Beehyv](https://www.beehyv.com/), [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/).

I am also actively involved with [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/) (Open Source Contributor), a Linux Foundation project and a Community Member at [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) User Group NYC. I am also a mentor at [amFOSS](https://amfoss.in/), the Open Source club of Amrita

My areas of interest include Software Engineering, DevOps, and Open Source Software. To date, I have made contributions to various open-source projects, including [GrimoireLab](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab/), [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/), [Bahmni](https://www.bahmni.org/), and [coveralls-python](https://github.com/TheKevJames/coveralls-python).

In my free time, ~I enjoy swimming and updating _this site_~ I apply for jobs. When not coding, ~I may be found watching episodes of [Monk (TV series)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312172/) or reading Robin Kirman's book, [The End of Getting Lost](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58438566)~ I apply for jobs.
