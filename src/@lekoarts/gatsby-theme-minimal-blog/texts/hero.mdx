I'm Venu, a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science from the [Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). Currently, I am working as a DevOps Engineer for the [FloodNet NYC](https://www.floodnet.nyc/) project in collaboration with [NYU's Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP)](https://cusp.nyu.edu/). I am actively involved with the [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) User Group NYC.

Prior to joining NYU, I gained professional experience as a Software Developer at [Beehyv](https://www.beehyv.com/) and as a Backend Developer at [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/). I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri](https://www.amrita.edu/campus/amritapuri/).

I am also actively involved in contributing to [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/), a Linux Foundation project. Additionally, I serve as a mentor at [amFOSS](https://amfoss.in/), the Open Source club of Amrita. My areas of interest include Software Engineering, MLOps, and Open Source Software. To date, I have made contributions to various open-source projects, including [GrimoireLab](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab/), [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/), [Bahmni](https://www.bahmni.org/), and [coveralls-python](https://github.com/TheKevJames/coveralls-python).

In my free time, I enjoy swimming and updating _this site_. When not coding, I may be found watching episodes of [Monk (TV series)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312172/) or reading Robin Kirman's book, [The End of Getting Lost](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58438566).
